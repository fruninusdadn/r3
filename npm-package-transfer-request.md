# Email to request npm package name transfer

**To:** torworx@gmail.com
**Subject:** Request for npm package name transfer: r3

Hi TY,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the npm package name "r3" that you currently own.

I've been developing a fully open-source (MIT licensed) memory management tool for AI applications called r3call (https://github.com/n3wth/r3call), which provides intelligent caching for LLM context using Redis and Mem0. This is a non-commercial, community-driven project that's been gaining traction in the AI/LLM community, and users have been requesting a shorter command name for easier CLI usage.

I noticed that the "r3" package on npm hasn't been updated since its initial 0.0.1 release over a year ago and appears to be a minimal utility. I was wondering if you'd be willing to transfer ownership of the npm package name "r3" to me, as it would be a perfect fit for our project's CLI command.

I'd be happy to:

- Credit you in our documentation if desired
- Help migrate any existing users if needed (though npm shows minimal usage)
- Ensure the namespace is used for an actively maintained open-source project

The r3call project is 100% open-source, MIT licensed, free to use, and actively maintained. It's purely a community tool serving the growing AI/LLM developer community with memory persistence solutions - no commercial interests involved.

Would you be open to discussing this transfer? I understand if you have plans for the name, but thought it was worth reaching out given the package's current state.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
Oliver

**Alternative approach if no response:**
If you don't receive a response within 2-3 weeks, you could also file a package name dispute with npm support, as the package appears abandoned (no updates, no repository activity, minimal functionality).
