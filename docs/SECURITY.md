## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of r3 seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to report the vulnerability.
3. Provide as much information as possible about the vulnerability:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We will send a more detailed response within 96 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.
- We will credit you in the security advisory if you desire.

### Security Update Process

1. The security team will investigate the vulnerability and determine its impact.
2. A fix will be developed privately.
3. We will prepare a new release containing the fix.
4. We will publish a security advisory detailing the vulnerability and the fix.

## Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all operations
3. **Data Minimization**: Store only necessary information
4. **Secure by Default**: Safe configurations out of the box
5. **Zero Trust**: Verify all inputs and connections

## Security Best Practices

When using r3:

### Environment Variables

- Never commit API keys to version control.
- Use environment-specific configurations.
- Rotate API keys regularly.
- Use secrets management systems in production.

### Redis Security

- Always use Redis AUTH when exposed to a network.
- Enable TLS for Redis connections in production.
- Restrict Redis access to trusted networks only.
- Keep your Redis version updated.

### API Key Management

- Store Mem0 API keys securely.
- Use different API keys for different environments.
- Monitor API key usage for anomalies.
- Implement rate limiting on your MCP server.

### Data Protection

- Be aware that cached data in Redis may contain sensitive information.
- Implement proper access controls.
- Consider encrypting sensitive data before caching.
- Regularly audit cached data.
- Use TTL (Time To Live) for sensitive data expiration.
- Implement data classification policies.

### Network Security

- Use TLS 1.3+ for all network communications.
- Implement network segmentation for Redis instances.
- Use VPN or private networks for production deployments.
- Configure firewall rules to restrict access.
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement strong authentication for all API endpoints.
- Use JWT tokens with short expiration times.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- Regular audit of access permissions.
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access.

### Input Validation

- Validate all inputs against expected schemas.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Use parameterized queries for database operations.
- Validate file uploads and limit file sizes.

### Logging and Monitoring

- Log all security-relevant events.
- Implement centralized logging.
- Monitor for suspicious patterns.
- Set up alerts for security incidents.
- Regular review of security logs.
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data.

## Dependencies

We use automated tools to monitor and update dependencies:

- Dependabot for automated security updates.
- `npm audit` in our CI pipeline.
- Regular manual review of critical dependencies.
- SNYK integration for vulnerability scanning.
- License compliance checking.
- Supply chain security verification.

### Dependency Management Policy

1. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated monthly or when security patches are available.
2. **Version Pinning**: Lock file committed to ensure reproducible builds.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning on every commit.
4. **License Review**: All dependencies must have compatible licenses.
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Regularly audit and remove unnecessary dependencies.

## Incident Response

### Response Team

The security response team consists of:

- Project maintainers
- Security advisors
- Community security contributors

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Identify and verify the security incident.
2. **Containment**: Limit the impact of the incident.
3. **Investigation**: Determine the root cause and extent.
4. **Remediation**: Fix the vulnerability and deploy patches.
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations.
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned.

### Communication

- Security advisories published on GitHub.
- Email notifications to registered users (when applicable).
- Documentation updates reflecting security changes.
- Transparent communication about incident timeline.

## Compliance

### Standards and Frameworks

- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- CWE/SANS Top 25 awareness
- GDPR considerations for EU users
- SOC 2 principles (where applicable)

### Regular Security Activities

- Quarterly security reviews
- Annual penetration testing (for production deployments)
- Code security scanning with every release
- Security training for contributors
