   - Kong configuration
   - Rate limiting rules
   - Authentication middleware

2. **Event Bus Infrastructure** (2-3 days)
   - Kafka cluster setup
   - Event schema registry
   - Dead letter queue handling

3. **Monitoring Stack** (1-2 days)
   - Prometheus exporters
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert rules configuration

### Medium Priority
1. **Data Migration Tools** (2-3 days)
   - PostgreSQL migration scripts
   - Redis data import/export
   - Backup automation

2. **Contract Testing** (1-2 days)
   - OpenAPI validation
   - AsyncAPI testing
   - Integration test suite

3. **Performance Testing** (2-3 days)
   - Load testing scripts
   - Benchmark suite
   - Performance monitoring

## Blocked Tasks

### Waiting on Dependencies
- **Kubernetes Deployment** - Waiting on: API Gateway completion
- **Service Mesh Setup** - Waiting on: All core services running
- **End-to-end Testing** - Waiting on: Integration complete

## Completed This Week

### Monday
- [x] Microservices architecture design
- [x] Agent orchestration plan
- [x] Project context documentation

### Tuesday
- [x] Memory update implementation
- [x] Batch operations manager
- [x] WebSocket basic server

### Wednesday (Today)
- [x] Vector embeddings foundation
- [x] META_VISION document
- [x] Task structure setup

## Task Assignment Rules

1. **Claim a task** by adding your identifier
2. **Mark as in-progress** with `[~]`
3. **Update daily** with progress notes
4. **Mark complete** with `[x]` when done
5. **Document blockers** immediately

## Sprint Goals

### This Week (Week 1)
- [ ] All core services have basic implementation
- [ ] API contracts defined for all services
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Next Week (Week 2)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring implemented
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Production ready

## Coordination Points

### Daily Sync (9:00 UTC)
Post updates in format:
```
Service: [Your Service]
Yesterday: [What you completed]
Today: [What you're working on]
Blockers: [Any issues]
```

### Integration Points
Services that need to coordinate:
- Storage ↔ Embedding: Data pipeline
- Search ↔ Graph: Enhanced ranking
- All Services ↔ Event Bus: Event flow
- All Services ↔ API Gateway: Routing

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 80% test coverage
- ✅ API latency <100ms p99
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ All contracts defined

## Notes

- Prioritize contract definition over implementation
- Write tests as you code
- Document decisions in ADRs
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Ask for help when blocked >2 hours
