# Introduction to Recall

Build AI applications with persistent, intelligent memory that scales from development to production.

## What is Recall?

Recall is a hybrid memory system designed specifically for AI applications, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and agents. It provides a sophisticated memory layer that combines:

- **Redis Cache** for lightning-fast memory retrieval (sub-millisecond response times)
- **Mem0 Cloud** for persistent, searchable long-term memory
- **Intelligent synchronization** between cache and cloud storage
- **Priority-based caching** to keep important memories instantly accessible

## Key Features

### Hybrid Architecture
Seamlessly combines local Redis caching with cloud persistence, giving you the best of both worlds - speed and reliability.

### Intelligent Caching
Automatically manages cache based on usage patterns, priority levels, and access frequency to optimize performance.

### Simple Integration
Drop-in replacement for existing memory systems with a clean, intuitive API that works with any AI framework.

### Production Ready
Built for scale with automatic failover, health monitoring, and comprehensive error handling.

## Why Recall?

### The Problem

Traditional AI memory systems force you to choose between:
- **Speed**: Local storage is fast but volatile and doesn't scale
- **Persistence**: Cloud storage is reliable but adds latency
- **Complexity**: Managing both systems manually is error-prone

### The Solution

Recall automatically manages a hybrid memory system that:
- Serves frequently accessed memories from cache in under 1ms
- Persists all memories to the cloud for reliability
- Synchronizes changes automatically
- Handles failures gracefully with automatic fallback

## Core Concepts

### Memory
A memory is a piece of information stored with metadata including:
- Content (text, structured data, embeddings)
- User association
- Priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
- Timestamps and access patterns
- Custom metadata

### Cache Layers
Recall uses a multi-tier caching strategy:
- **Hot Cache**: Most frequently accessed memories (Redis)
- **Warm Storage**: Recent or important memories (Mem0)
- **Cold Storage**: All historical memories (Cloud)

### Synchronization
Automatic bi-directional sync ensures:
- New memories are cached and persisted
- Cache misses are filled from cloud
- Updates propagate to all layers
- Consistency is maintained

## Use Cases

### AI Assistants
Give your AI assistants long-term memory about user preferences, conversation history, and learned behaviors.

### Customer Support Bots
Remember customer issues, preferences, and resolution history across all interactions.

### Personalization Engines
Build recommendation systems that remember and learn from every user interaction.

### Knowledge Management
Create intelligent knowledge bases that remember facts, relationships, and context.

## Quick Example

```python
from recall import RecallClient

# Initialize with simple configuration
client = RecallClient(
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379",
    mem0_api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Store a memory
client.add("User prefers dark mode interfaces",
          user_id="user123",
          priority="high")

# Retrieve memories (served from cache if available)
memories = client.search("user interface preferences",
                        user_id="user123")

# Memories are automatically cached for fast access
# and persisted to cloud for reliability
```
