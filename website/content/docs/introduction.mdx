# Introduction

Recall is a high-performance memory layer that combines local Redis caching with cloud persistence, delivering sub-5ms response times for AI applications.

## Overview

Recall provides intelligent memory management for LLMs and AI agents, automatically handling caching, synchronization, and failover between local and cloud storage.

### Key Features

- **Lightning Fast**: Sub-5ms cache hits with intelligent prefetching
- **Enterprise Security**: Bank-level encryption with SOC 2 compliance
- **Infinite Scale**: Automatically scales from prototype to production
- **AI Optimized**: Purpose-built for LLMs with semantic search and vector support

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @n3wth/recall --demo
```

No API key required for demo mode. For production use:

```bash
npm install -g @n3wth/recall
export MEM0_API_KEY="your-api-key"
recall-cli
```

## Architecture

Recall uses a two-tier caching system:

- **L1 Cache**: Hot data with 24-hour TTL for frequently accessed memories
- **L2 Cache**: Warm data with 7-day TTL for less frequent access
- **Cloud Persistence**: Mem0 cloud storage for permanent retention

The system automatically promotes and demotes memories between tiers based on access patterns.

## Use Cases

- **Conversational AI**: Maintain context across chat sessions
- **Personalization**: Store user preferences and behavior patterns
- **Knowledge Management**: Build persistent knowledge bases for AI agents
- **Session Management**: Handle stateful interactions at scale
