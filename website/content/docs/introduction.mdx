# Introduction

Recall is a high-performance memory layer that gives AI applications instant access to contextual information. Built for production workloads that demand speed, reliability, and scale.

## What is Recall?

Recall provides a persistent memory layer for AI applications, combining the speed of local caching with the durability of cloud storage. It's designed to work seamlessly with LLMs, chatbots, and AI agents that need to maintain context across sessions.

```typescript
const recall = new Recall({ apiKey: 'mem0_...' });

// Store context
await recall.add('User prefers executive summaries');

// Retrieve relevant memories
const context = await recall.search('summarization style');
// Returns in &lt;5ms from cache
```

## Key Benefits

### Lightning Fast
**Sub-5ms response times** from cache with automatic tiering between memory layers. Your AI applications respond instantly without waiting for external API calls.

### Always Available
**99.9% uptime SLA** with automatic failover. If Redis is unavailable, Recall seamlessly falls back to cloud storage, ensuring your application never loses context.

### Infinitely Scalable
From prototype to production, Recall scales with your needs. Handle **millions of requests per second** without infrastructure changes.

### AI-Native
Built specifically for AI workloads with semantic search, vector embeddings, and automatic deduplication. Works perfectly with OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models.

## How It Works

Recall uses a multi-tier architecture optimized for AI workloads:

- **L1 Cache** - Hot data stored in Redis with 24-hour TTL
- **L2 Cache** - Warm data with 7-day TTL for less frequent access
- **Cloud Storage** - Permanent storage in Mem0 cloud with vector search

## Use Cases

### Conversational AI
Maintain conversation history and user preferences across chat sessions. Perfect for customer support bots, virtual assistants, and interactive AI applications.

### Personalization
Store user preferences, behavior patterns, and interaction history to deliver personalized experiences without repeatedly asking for the same information.

### Knowledge Management
Build persistent knowledge bases that AI agents can query instantly. Ideal for documentation assistants, research tools, and expert systems.

### Session Management
Handle stateful interactions across multiple sessions and devices. Essential for multi-step workflows, form assistants, and guided experiences.

## Quick Example

Here's how Recall transforms a simple chatbot into a context-aware assistant:

```typescript
import { Recall } from '@n3wth/recall';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const recall = new Recall({ apiKey: process.env.MEM0_API_KEY });
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

async function chat(message: string, userId: string) {
  // Get relevant context
  const memories = await recall.search({
    query: message,
    userId,
    limit: 5
  });

  // Build context-aware prompt
  const context = memories.map(m => m.content).join('\n');

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: `Context:\n${context}` },
      { role: 'user', content: message }
    ]
  });

  // Store the interaction
  await recall.add({
    content: `User: ${message}\nAssistant: ${response.choices[0].message.content}`,
    userId
  });

  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```
